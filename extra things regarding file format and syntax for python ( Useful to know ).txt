1. When defining a function it is always better to leave 2 lines after it.
    --- E.g :
    def func(x=1):
        return x ** 2
    ( 1st space line )
    ( 2nd space line )
    call = func()
    print(call)

 2. Basically any values like a string or any number when applied to a condition is == to True
 in boolean while only ( False ) and ( 0 ) will return a False answer for boolean operations
