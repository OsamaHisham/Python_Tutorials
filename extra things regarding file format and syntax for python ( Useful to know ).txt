1. When defining a function it is always better to leave 2 lines after it.
    --- E.g ---
    def func(x=1):
        return x ** 2
    ( 1st space line )
    ( 2nd space line )
    call = func()
    print(call)

2. Basically any values like a string or any number when applied to a condition is == to True
in boolean while only ( False ) and ( 0 ) will return a False answer for boolean operations

3. Printing strings on multiple lines can make text more readable to humans. With multiple lines,
strings can be grouped into clean and orderly text, formatted as a letter, or used to maintain the linebreaks of a poem or song lyrics.
To create strings that span multiple lines, triple single quotes ''' or triple double quotes """ are used to enclose the string.
--- E.g (1) ---
'''
This string is on
multiple lines
within three single
quotes on either side.
'''
 --- E.g (2) ---
"""
This string is on
multiple lines
within three double
quotes on either side.
"""
